# Connect GCP VM to VS Code via ssh
1.) In Terminal, create a ssh key(s)
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C project-wide-user
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C local-wide-user
2.) Open up both public key files ie.  project-wide-user.pub
3.) Copy the key and go to Compute Engine -> Metadata -> Add SSH keys, then paste them there
4.) Go to VPC Network -> Firewall -> Add Firewall Rule (available ports are listed e.g. port tdp 22)
5.) Create a VM via Compute Engine -> VM Instances
6.) Go to Terminal and connect to VM using the externel ip address and ssh keys 
ssh -i projectwideuser projectwideuser@ExternalIP

# Create a Kubernetes Cluster (K8)
1.) Create App
2.) Create Docker File
3.) Build Container Image
4.) Push to Container Registry
5.) Create Cluster and set node size
6.) Add a Deployement.yaml and Services.yaml file 
There are templates for these so just copy them over and edit them to your liking
7.) Speaking of editing, configure the Deployement to set the number of pods used per node
8.) Edit the Services.yaml file to whatever you need. This is what interacts with the Load Balancer
9.) Generate the Pods via Deployment.yaml
10.) Expose cluster to outside network
11.) Copy externel IP address from the LoadBalancer and paste it into web browser
