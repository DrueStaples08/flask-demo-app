In order to start a new environment, follow the folowing steps:

1.) If you already have a vm and you want those packages to be copied over, then run the command below to create a file that holds the packages and the versions of each.

$ pip freeze > requirements.txt


2.) Copy content into temporary folder - if you dont have one, then just 'mkdir ~/temporary' a new folder 

$ cp requirements.txt ~/temporary


3.) Cd into temporary folder

$ cd ~/temporary


4.) Create new environment

$ python -m venv venv36


5.) Mv requirements file from ~/temporary to ~/temporary/venv36 - This way when you create new vm's, the requirements for each wont get jumbled up

$ mv requirements.txt ~/temporary/venv36 

or 

$ mv requirements.txt venv36 
(since I'm already located in temporary folder)


6.) Activate new vm

$ source ./venv36/bin/activate


7.) Install requirements file 

$ pip install -r requirements.txt
